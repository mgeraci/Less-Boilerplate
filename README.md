Less Boilerplate
=============================

Boilerplate CSS written in [Less.CSS](http://lesscss.org/), the dynamic stylesheet language. It includes: 

- CSS Reset
- CSS3 Helpers (box radius, gradients, box shadow, transition)
- Centered column blocks
- Horizontal centering for objects of variable width
- A fancy call to action button
- A few general styles and sensible defaults (including a clearfix)

I went through my recent design projects and pulled out these styles that I use all the time to create an easy-to-import stylesheet. They help me get a new design started, and I hope they help you too!

If you like how this looks but you're a SASS coder, check out [SASS Boilerplate](http://mgeraci.github.com/SASS-Boilerplate).
